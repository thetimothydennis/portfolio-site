                        Hi, I'm Timothy Dennis. My official coding career may be short at this point, 
                        but I've been programming in some sort or fashion for mroe than 20 years. 
                        What started as a fascination with HTML and CSS in high school morphed into 
                        an obsession with producing multimedia content and a respectable career in radio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even in my career as a radio producer and engineer, I've still programmed throughout 
                        the years. Producing audio in a non-linear way is a type of programming, but I also 
                        taught myself how to program my station's automation equipment and became its caretaker 
                        for several years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More recently, I've discovered JavaScript, and I am blown away every day with the possibilities 
                        that come from knowing how to use JS to build a full-stack web application. Below you can find a 
                        list of projects I've built, and below that is a list of the skills in which I consider myself 
                        proficient.
